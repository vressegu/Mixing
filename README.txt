Compute Lagrangian advection and several mixing diagnoses, from synthetic and real oceanographic data.
For real satellite image tests, globcurrent data can be used.

This codes needs the MATLAB image processing toolbox.
Launch the script main.m to execute the algorithm.
Plots and MAT-files are saved each day of simulation in the folder images.

Several parameters can be changed easily in the beginning of the script main.m.

The pdf is a NOT-published draft which is associated with the code.
